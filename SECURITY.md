## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly.

**Do not** open a public GitHub issue for security-sensitive bugs.

Instead:

1. **Email or private contact**: If you have a way to contact the maintainer privately (e.g. via GitHub profile or email), send a concise description of the issue and steps to reproduce.
2. **Private security advisory**: On GitHub, go to the [Security](https://github.com/Gideon1107/Cognifast-ai/security) tab → **Advisories** → **Report a vulnerability**. Describe the issue and how it can be reproduced. This creates a private discussion visible only to maintainers and you.

We will:

- Confirm receipt of your report.
- Work on a fix and keep you updated when appropriate.
- Credit you in the advisory and release notes (unless you prefer to stay anonymous).

We ask that you give us a reasonable time to address the issue before any public disclosure.

Thank you for helping keep Cognifast AI and its users safe.
