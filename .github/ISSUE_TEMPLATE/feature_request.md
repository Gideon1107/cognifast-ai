## Problem or use case

What problem does this solve, or what use case does it enable? (e.g. "I want to export my chat so I can share it with my study group.")

## Proposed solution

Describe the feature or change you’d like. Be as specific as you can (e.g. "Add an Export as PDF button in the conversation header that downloads the current thread as a PDF with citations.")

## Alternatives considered

Any other approaches you thought about (e.g. "Could also be Markdown export only.")

## Additional context

Mockups, links to similar features elsewhere, or other context.
